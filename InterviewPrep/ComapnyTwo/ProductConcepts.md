# How do you work with designers to ensure the final product aligns with the design vision?

Coming from a startup, I've had the experience to cross-collaborate with various teams, including product, marketing, QA, and design. There have been instances where stakeholders and product had a specific vision that was initially difficult to replicate in design due to many factors, including technical limitations and resource constraints. It required patience, communication, and iteration to align everyone's expectations while balancing feasibility with creativity.

# How did you and your teammates or project manager work together on a specific project?

In my last role at Ultraviolet, a startup of around twenty people, I quickly transitioned from an intern to working closely with various teams, including design, marketing, product, and QA. I collaborated with our project manager to define the scope of end-to-end features, participated in sprint planning, and ensured that tasks prioritized clarity for the team. If any ambiguity arose, we proactively sought clarification to maintain alignment and productivity by informing our project manager, who would direct us to the necessary teams.

# How did you give/get feedback from others?

At Ultraviolet, we followed the Agile methodology with two-week sprints. Feedback was primarily gathered during the user acceptance testing (UAT) phase, where stakeholders evaluated changes against business requirements. If changes were requested, we collaborated with the project manager to address the issues and improve future processes. This feedback loop ensured continuous improvement throughout the development pipeline. I often received constructive criticism, which I always saw as an opportunity for growth.

# Was there a time when you and your PM/stakeholders disagreed about something?

There was a time when I disagreed with both the stakeholders and the project manager regarding a feature request. The stakeholders wanted creators in club chats to upload videos directly from their camera roll, some as large as 3 GB. However, the third-party chat service we used only supported file uploads up to 100 MB and didn’t offer custom CDN options. Instead of focusing on the limitation, I proposed a new feature that handled large file uploads in the background, ultimately leading to a solution that allowed users to either upload free content or monetize it, providing flexibility and value.

# How did you and your PM stay on the same page regarding tasks/work?

Context-based communication is essential when working with non-technical team members. As developers, we often use technical jargon that can lead to miscommunication. I've learned to break down complex technical ideas in ways that are accessible to everyone, especially project managers who may not have a technical background. This approach helped reduce ambiguity and fostered transparent communication within the team. Sprint planning allowed engineers to voice potential roadblocks or complexities, and we maintained consistent communication through Jira tasks and Slack for daily updates.

# Tell me about a time when you had to explain a complex technical part to someone who was less technical.

At my last company, the founder, co-founder, and product manager were mostly non-technical. One time, we worked on a feature called Chat Polls, which involved creating interactive polls in club chats. The stakeholders were considering hiring a machine learning team to build AI functionality from scratch to auto-generate poll questions. I explained that we could save time and money by integrating Open AI's API to generate custom questions based on existing data. After breaking down the integration into our current system, they agreed it was the most efficient solution.

# Was there a time when you had to cut down on scope to deliver something quickly?

At my last position at Ultraviolet, I was tasked with overhauling the authentication system, which initially included supporting Apple ID login. The challenge arose when users who purchased club access on the web—specifically to avoid Apple’s App Store purchase fee—would then log in via email in the app and were confused as to why they didn’t have access to the club. The design team proposed adding CTA text and pop-up modals to guide users when logging in, while the product team considered removing Apple ID entirely to resolve the issue. I pointed out that removing Apple ID would introduce several edge cases, such as migrating existing Apple ID accounts via Auth0 and prompting users to update their login method, which would increase scope and complexity. To mitigate this, I suggested we first implement the CTA text and guidance as a quicker fix to address the confusion. This allowed us to improve the user experience immediately while buying time to fully scope out the complexities of removing Apple ID. Ultimately, the decision was made to remove Apple ID, and I was tasked with executing that. I’m glad we went with the CTA text first because the full removal turned out to be quite complex, involving migrations and edge case handling. By phasing the solution, we managed to avoid overwhelming the team and kept the project on track.

# Was there a time when you came up with a short-term workaround for a problem?

There were many instances where the development team was short on time, specifically due to our small size of about 4-5 developers. I was tasked with removing technical debt that had accumulated over the years and was causing several users to experience crashes. It was concerning, as most of the developers who had written the original code had left the company. I quickly had to become accustomed to the practices they used and figure out the root cause of the bugs. Thankfully, I had previously implemented analytics and bug tracking systems via Datadog and Sentry, which provided detailed crash and bug reports. The issue stemmed from tightly coupled logic in which certain screens had components making too many network calls, causing unnecessary refreshes. Undoing this logic would have created additional problems across the app, leading to a domino effect. Given our limited time and resources, I initially considered overhauling specific screens by creating components dedicated to handling only the necessary logic for those screens. This allowed me to isolate the issues without disrupting the rest of the app and release a patch update to reduce the crashes after user acceptance testing to confirm the issue was solved. This, however, was a short-term solution; afterward, I took the extra time to unravel the proverbial web of logic and applied good software design principles to ensure the code was effective and stable throughout the app.

# Tell me about a time when you worked with product to help them make a technical decision.

In my previous role, I was frequently involved in feature requirement meetings, where technical feasibility and scope were discussed with the product team. My input was often needed to guide decisions around the effort involved and the limitations of implementing certain features. One particular situation where I made a significant impact was during a discussion about the accumulated technical debt in the project and the prospect of a refactor. The product team was leaning towards refactoring, but they were concerned about the time it would take and the potential impact on maintaining the current app iteration. I proposed a solution where we divided the work into two teams: one focused on maintaining and updating the existing app while the other concentrated on building a new repository with strict coding standards and best practices. I ended up being responsible for managing both aspects of this effort. By implementing this strategy, we were able to keep the current product running smoothly while simultaneously building a stronger, cleaner codebase for the new version. This approach allowed us to successfully release a new update with a more polished design, all while mitigating risk to our ongoing operations.

# Was there a time when you had to deliver something in a time crunch? What are you working on now (or some sample project)? Why does/did it matter? How did it affect the user(s)?

After being let go from Ultraviolet due to budget cuts, I wanted to keep my skills sharp and began thinking of ways to expand my skill set. I decided to dive deeper into the business side of product development. I had an app idea that had been simmering in my mind for a while. Though it started as more of a hobby than a full-fledged business, I wanted to treat it like one to learn different processes. I began conducting market research to understand the challenges users face in their gym environments. My focus shifted from engineering solutions to understanding user pain points, changing my mindset from feature development to product strategy. Using this data, I created user personas and product requirements, working with my teammates to sketch wireframes that aligned with our vision. I also contracted a new-grad designer to help us with the UX/UI. Throughout the process, I was responsible for both the business and development aspects—coordinating with the designer, managing the project, and ensuring everyone stayed on the same page. During small user testing, we realized that users initially didn’t fully understand the app’s purpose, so I went through a pivot, learning valuable lessons from that experience.

# What was the overall vision? What were the goals?

The first iteration of the app was focused on enhancing and simplifying the process of sharing athletic progress in the forms of pictures, videos, and workout data between various entities such as friends, gyms, and themselves, while reinforcing positive social reinforcement. However, it seemed people were more interested in comparing themselves with their past selves rather than with others, which is why we pivoted. I was managing other developers and onboarding them, teaching them how to communicate properly with the other teams (which were only like one other person).

# How did the team measure success?

# How do you typically work on cross-functional teams?

# How do you prioritize your assignments?

I prioritize my assignments based on a few key factors: business impact, technical feasibility, and blocking dependencies. At my last company, I followed a similar approach, often using ticket sizes as an initial indicator of these factors. First, I look for tasks that can be completed quickly and efficiently to create momentum, especially if they unblock other work. Then, I consider business goals and connect with the product manager to ensure that my work aligns with the sprint objectives and overall product vision. By focusing on tasks that deliver value quickly while keeping an eye on the bigger business goals, I ensure that we’re meeting both short-term and long-term priorities."
